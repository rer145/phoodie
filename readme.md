### Application
Phoodie
Swipe. Eat. Repeat.
(Tinder meets Uber for Food)

### Overview
It’s 6 o’clock, I’ve had exhausting day at work.  I’m hungry (the kids are hungry) I don’t feel like cooking, I don’t feel like pizza, and I don’t want to go out.  And the kicker -even though I’m hungry, I don’t know what I want to eat. 

Phoodie connects eaters to eats.  I can swipe though the app and actually see what is available. For a nominal delivery fee, dinner is delivered. 

Our application acts as the middleman.  Restaurants post offerings by supplying a picture and short description.  Phoodie connects the food vender to the consumer:  The order is placed and the delivery is coordinated through postmates or uber for pickup at the restaurant and delivery to the consumer.

### Our business model
1.	limited delivery area.  Offerings are based on the user’s location for reasonable delivery times and to limit the delivery costs.
2.	Limited upfront costs to restaurants (they provide the pictures and descriptions).  No subscription or monthly fees, restaurants pay a nominal fee as items are sold.  
3.	Reasonable delivery charge to customers; since delivery is limited.
4.	Based on immediacy and ease of use.  Swipe through choices, click/pick what you want and it is delivered to your door.
5.	Profit based on high volume.  Ease of use and reasonable pricing will result in repeat business.

Our application is quick, immediate & easy to use.  You swipe, select and food shows up at your door.

**Innovative**
We could not find a similar app in use when we did a google search.  

**Ease of use**
We created a simple user interface based on the tinder ‘swipe’ model (except we can go backwards and forwards).  Once you find an item you want a quick click to add to cart & then check out.  The application ‘saves’ user delivery card credit card data (but allows a different delivery or credit card number to be included.

**Functionality**
We have a mvp, minimally viable product.  Due to the time constraints of this weekend we discussed various aspects that we could not complete: 
* 'Favorites' Foods a preference pages to limit the choices shown
* Search feature based on type/name (favorites)
* Send e-mail with a survey on the order/service after the order
* Payment method additional options (gift cards, additional credit cards)
* Complete development of back end order placement screens (interface with delivery & restaurant)
